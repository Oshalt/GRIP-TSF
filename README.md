Task # 2 - To Explore
Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we will predict the percentage ofmarks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

Task # 3 - To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

Task # 4 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier andvisualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Task # 5 - To explore Business Analytics

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’. You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see
how your company is performing. You are interested in finding out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
What all business problems you can derive by looking into the data? You can choose any of the tool of your choice(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
